 Project Overview
The Pizza Sales Report Dashboard is a Business Intelligence (BI) project created using Power BI and a transactional dataset from a pizza delivery business. The aim is to visualize business performance and provide insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance to support better strategic decisions.

This project transforms raw sales data into actionable insights through interactive dashboards, helping business stakeholders track KPIs, optimize operations, and maximize profitability.


Problem Statement
Pizza delivery businesses often face challenges like:

Huge volumes of unorganized sales data from multiple time periods.

Difficulty identifying peak demand times and popular menu items.

Inefficiencies in supply chain due to unpredictable sales.

Manual reporting causing delays in business decisions.

Without proper data visualization, important performance indicators get overlooked, leading to revenue losses and poor customer service.


Solution Approach
To solve these challenges, a complete end-to-end BI solution was developed using Power BI.

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Imported pizza_sales.csv into Power BI.

Checked for missing values and duplicates.

Converted columns into appropriate data types (e.g., Date, Time, Integer).

Created time-based columns like:

Hour of Order

Day Name

Month Name

2. Data Modeling
Built a single-table model for simplicity.

Created DAX measures for:

Total Revenue

Total Pizzas Sold

Average Order Value

Revenue per Category, Size, and Day

3. Dashboard Development
Built an interactive Power BI dashboard that includes:

KPI Cards showing total sales, total pizzas sold, average order value, etc.

Bar/Column Charts for best and worst-performing pizza types.

Line Charts showing revenue and sales trends over time.

Pie Charts / Donuts to show pizza sales by size and category.

Heatmaps to visualize peak sales hours or days.

Filters and Slicers for Date, Category, Size, etc.
